# Quant Tool Collections

.NET Standard Library

Contains the most reusable functions in the domain of **quantitative trading**.

## Features

QuantTC mainly supports the following features:

+ Technical Indicators
+ Relational Predicates
+ Core Data Types

## Compatibility

Because of the lastest feature `System.ValueTuple`:

The runtime environment should satisfy one of the following conditions:

+ .NET Standard 2.0 and above
+ .NET Framework 4.7 and above
+ .NET Core 1.0 and above

For some developpers, the SDK should support C# 7.0 and above to use **ValueTuple Syntax**.

**Note that** you needn't to prepare the C# 7.0+ SDK, if you're just using the API which doesn't use the ValueTuple syntax.
